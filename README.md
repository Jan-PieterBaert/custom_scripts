# Custom scripts
This repo contains several scripts that make our lives easier.

All of these scripts can be installed to `~/.local/bin` by using make.

More information for the commands can be found in the README's in each folder.

## IMPORTANT
We five no guarantees that these scripts will work on any machine, nor that they work as intended.
Always check the cmd's before you execute them, as they otherwise might harm your device.
